ParaScribe
==========

The ParaScribe plugin is devoted to users that are not expert in UML. This tool paraphrases UML class diagrams in natural language for validation purposes or learning purposes.

Examples of paraphrases are available in some the following slides:

* `DiagrammesDeClasses-ConceptsDeBase`_
* `DiagrammesDeClasses-ConceptsAvances`_

ParaScribe provides some paraphases for the selected elements. It can either
describe the meaning of elements or ask questions for validating the elements.
In this case a form is generated allowing a non-expert can easily provide
feedback. As the result the model is modified or in the case where this is not
possible the model is annotated.
